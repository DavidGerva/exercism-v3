# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how the Concept of Numbers is implemented in Elixir. It will introduce this concept through the two most common numeric types in Elixir: `integer` (whole number) and `float` (floating-point number).

## Learning objectives

- Know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `integer` and `float`.
- Understand that an `integer` represents whole numbers, and a `float` represents floating-point numbers.
- Know of basic operators such as multiplication and comparison.
- Know how to convert from one numeric type to another; know that some operations can cause implicit conversion.
- Know how to conditionally execute code

## Out of scope

- Any other numeric types besides `integer` and `float` (so no `binary`, `boolean`, etc.).
- Parsing a `string` to an `integer` or `float`.
- Converting an `integer` or `float` to a `string`.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `variables`: know that variables are bound on assignment and are dynamically typed.
- `type`: know that vales have a type, and variables are dynamically typed on binding.
- `numbers`: know of the existence of the two most commonly used number types, `integer` and `float`; understand that the former represents whole numbers, and the latter floating-point numbers; know of basic operators such as multiplication and comparison.
- `cond-control-flow`: know how to conditionally execute code using an `cond..do` expressions.
- `implicit-return`: know that the result of the last expression in a function is the value that is returned when the function execution is complete.

## Prequisites

There are no prerequisites.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].

# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student the basics of the Concept of Functions in [F#][functions].

## Learning objectives

- Know how to define a function.
- Know how to return a value from a function.
- Know how to call a function.
- Know how to define scope using significant whitespace.
- Know that type inference works for functions.

## Out of scope

- Returning functions.
- Recursive functions.
- Higher-order functions.
- Anonymous functions
- Inline functions.
- Pure functions.
- Partial application.
- Currying.
- Organizing functions in modules and namespaces.
- Visibility.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `functions-basic`: know how to define a function; know how to return a value from a function; know how to call a function; know how to define scope using significant whitespace; know how scoping works in a function.

## Prequisites

- `values-basic`: required to know how to define a binding.
- `type-inference-basic`: required to know what type inference is and how it applies to bindings.

## Representer

This exercise does not require any specific representation logic to be added to the [representer][representer].

## Analyzer

This exercise does not require any specific logic to be added to the [analyzer][analyzer].
